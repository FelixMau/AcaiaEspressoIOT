# AcaiaArduinoBLE
Acaia Scale Gateway using the ArduinoBLE library for devices such as the esp32, arduino nano esp32, and arduino nano iot 33.
This is an Arduino Library which can be found in the Arduino IDE Library Manager.

Tested on the Arduino Nano ESP32 and Acaia Pyxis, using Arduino IDE 2.2.1 and ArduinoBLE 1.3.6

## Requirements
This library is intended to be used with any arduino device which is compatible with the [ArduinoBLE](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/arduinoble/) library.

# Acknowledgement
This is largely a basic port of the [LunarGateway](https://github.com/frowin/LunarGateway/) library written for the ESP32.
